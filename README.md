#1.3-timeline-layout

* I built this pixel-perfect timeline layout during Week 1 at The Iron Yard. The project's goal was to continue practice with CSS and be able to conform to a design comp on the pixel level. There is a link to the live project in the description and you can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
